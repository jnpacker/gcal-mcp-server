# Behavior tuning
# - primary_provider is the canonical source when a sync conflict occurs
# - If omitted, the most recently modified of the three becomes primary
primary_provider: auto

# Notes:
# - The script should always preserve existing indentation and whitespace.
# - Gemini TOML prompts must end with a closing triple quote on the last line.
