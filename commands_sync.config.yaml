# Configuration for syncing command prompt files across providers
# Each entry defines a command "core name" and the files that must stay in sync
# along with provider-specific header/footers.

# Behavior tuning
# - primary_provider is the canonical source when a sync conflict occurs
# - If omitted, the most recently modified of the three becomes primary
primary_provider: auto

# Notes:
# - The script should always preserve existing indentation and whitespace.
# - Gemini TOML prompts must end with a closing triple quote on the last line.
